World Vision plays an international leadership role improving outcomes in the areas of education, health, and economic growth with a specific focus among vulnerable children. They are also a member of the Canadian Council of Christian Charities (CCCC) and the Better Business Bureau were ranked as one of the top 100 charities in Canada in 2020 by Charity Intelligence Canada."
